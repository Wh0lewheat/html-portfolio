<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
My name is Frank Soriano. I'm a Mexican American living a Osaka Japan. I'm originally from New Jersey, in the United States. My parents however, are from Puebla Mexico. 
I speak English, Spanish, Japanese, and I'm currently interested in learning Chinese. I am currently an English teacher with many years of experience in education, primarily Music Education. I am a Pianist and Guitarist
currently working on a YouTube Channel for Piano and Running a Rock Band in Osaka.

<p>
I'm a hardworking, driven, and sociable fellow. I enjoy playing the Piano, playing the Guitar, Exercising, Socializing, Reading, Learning new things, Coding, Traveling, and 
much more. I'd say that I have a passion for a fullfilling life.
</p>

<p>
My current goal is to find a way towards a comfortable financial future. To find multiple streams of income where not only I can benefit, but others can benefit as well.
Whether that is providing a product, a service, creating a business, a course, whatever it is... I'm searching for the path towards that and I am quite hellbent on finding it.

I hope we can meet soon 🙏🏽
